### Removing NA values from a Dataset variable 
Use filter() function to filter all values that are not NA with !is.na(variable). You can do this with multiple variables as well: 
```{r}
not_cancelled <- flights %>% 
  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(arr_delay))
```

### Keeping count on number of samples with group_by function
When using the group_by function, the data.frame becomes grouped by the different group of variables within a set of variables. 
Say you have the variable Ice Cream, within it you have "Vanille", "Strawberry", "Nuts", etc. Group_by function allows you to 
perform data transformation on those groups combined with summarise function and other useful summarise functions. 

### Summarize and functions used in combination

#### Subsetting in Summarize
You can subsett or filter a certain number of values from a variable within a dataset. For instance, say you only want to 
include flights that had positive delays in your summary, simply include a subsett notation: 
```{r}
summarize(mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay[dep_delay>0]))
```

#### Counts and Propotions through logical operators and summarise()
Recall that the logical operators <>|& will returun logical value, TRUE or FALSE. This means that when we write:
summarise(n_variables_higher_than_0 = sum(variable > 0), the function will return a count of all the TRUE values. 
Using mean(variable > 0) will give us a proportion, the proportion of the total number of variables that satisfy the 
criteria given (in this case, being larger than 0).

### Counting number of observations in a group of variables, excluding NA values and number of distinct values
count function counts the number of observation for each group within a variable. If there is a continous variable you want
the cumulative sum of, include the "wt" arguement, which stands for weighted tally??

```{r}
count(flights, destination)
count(flights, destination, wt = distance)
```

To exlude observations with NA values in any variable, use: 
```{r}
sum(!is.na(x)) 
```

To count number of distinct(unique) observations, use:
```{r}
n_distinct(x)
```

### Some Definitions

- A variable is a quantity, quality, or property that you can measure.

- A value is the state of a variable when you measure it. The value of a variable may change from measurement to measurement.

- An observation is a set of measurements made under similar conditions (you usually make all of the measurements in an observation 
at the same time and on the same object). An observation will contain several values, each associated with a different variable. 
I’ll sometimes refer to an observation as a data point.

- Tabular data is a set of values, each associated with a variable and an observation. Tabular data is tidy if each value is 
placed in its own “cell”, each variable in its own column, and each observation in its own row.
