Notes on R

*Removing NA values from a Dataset variable 
Use filter() function to filter all values that are not NA with !is.na(variable). 
You can do this with multiple variables as well. See Example: 

not_cancelled <- flights %>% 
  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(arr_delay))
  
  
*Keeping count on number of samples with group_by function
When using the group_by function, the data.frame becomes grouped by the different group of variables within a set of variables. 
Say you have the variable Ice Cream, within it you have "Vanille", "Strawberry", "Nuts", etc. Group_by function allows you to perform 
data transformation on those groups. For this purpose, 

*Subsetting in Summarize
You can subsett or filter a certain number of values from a variable within a dataset. For instance, say you only want to include flights 
that had positive delays in your summarize(mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay))Simply include a subsett notation: 

summarize(mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay[dep_delay>0]))

*Counting number of observations in a group of variables, excluding NA values and number of distinct values
count function counts the number of observation for each group within a variable. If there is a continous variable you want
the cumulative sum of, include the "wt" arguement, which stands for weighted tally??

count(flights, destination)
count(flights, destination, wt = distance)

To exlude observations with NA values in any variable, use: 
sum(!is.na(x)) 

To count number of distinct(unique) observations, use:
n_distinct(x)
